# Wasserstein-Fourier

## A distance between time-series
The Wasserstein-Fourrier is a distance between time series. 
The 'toy_data.ipynb' illustrate basic properties of the distance on synthetic datasets.  

## Connexion with Machine Learning
Machine Learning models could benefit from the rich geometry induced by the WF distance. 'softmax.py' is an implementation of Softmax regression equipped with the WF distance.

## Real world experiments
The notebooks '2_experiment_UrbanSound.ipynb' and '3_Activity_Recognition.ipynb' show how to operate the softmax regression algorithm on two real world datasets.
